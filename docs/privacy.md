**Google Calendar Data**

***the way to accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google Calendar data***

The Bustake runtime environment includes a Google Calendar Plugin. This Plugin connects the phone call with the Google Calendar. Programmers can use this plug-in to create voice applications, such as booking a Covid vaccination appointment. In order to successfully connect the phone call and Google Calendar, the Calendar owner's consent must first be obtained. Then the plug-in can query and create Google Calendar events to establish appointments. The user's appointment data is managed and saved through Google Calendar itself. The plug-in itself only acts as a bridge and provides a voice interface that allows users to select dates and create appointments.

In short, the plug-in itself only provides a bridge function and a voice interface. It does not manage the user's calendar data. It does not save any user data. It does not share any users' data.

The domain name of our service is `bustake.com`.
The link to access our service is `https://console.bustake.com` . This is the only link to access our service because the application is a one page web application.
